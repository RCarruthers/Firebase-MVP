FireBaseMVPDagger2
==========

Sample MVP Project containing Unit Tests, FireBase implementation and DI with Dagger2.

This is how a proper non-spagetti code should look like! It have a good architecture a slight defects here and there which can be fixed but i wanted to share my knowlege with the rest and see how they can manage to fix this if they can actually see the problems. This project contains a proper Dagger2 implementation and a good MVP architecture which can be easy maintained and tested.
